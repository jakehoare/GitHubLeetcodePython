# https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/
# You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2.
# Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.
# The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2.
# If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

# Map the integers to be found to their indices in the result. Iterate over nums2, maintaining a stack of nums seen
# without a greater number, hence stack is descending. For each num, pop from stack all smaller nums and update the
# result if they are in nums1. Add each num to stack.
# Time - O(n) len(nums2)
# Space - O(m) len(nums1)
