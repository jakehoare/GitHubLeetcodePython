# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-group-all-1s-together/
# Given a binary array data,
# return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.

# Count the number of ones.
# Iterate along the data with a sliding window of length of the number of ones.
# At each index, update the number of ones in the window.
# Update the result with the number of ones outside the window, that would have to move to group the ones together.
# Time - O(n)
# Space - O(1)
