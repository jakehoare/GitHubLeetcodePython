# https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower-ii/
# We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:  I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which
# number I picked.  Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower. However,
# when you guess a number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
# Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

# Dynamic programming.  Min money for any range is the minimum cost after all possible next guesses.  Min cost of
# a particular guess is the guess + worst case of having to recurse on the range either above or below the guess.
# Best guess  is never in LHS of range since then the RHS is longer and has greater numbers so we always want LHS to be
# longer.
# Alternatively, top-down recursive.
# Time - O(n**3)
# Space - O(n**2)
