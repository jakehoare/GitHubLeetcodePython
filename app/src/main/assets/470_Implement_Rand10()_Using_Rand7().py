# https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-rand10-using-rand7/
# Given a function rand7 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 7, write a function rand10 which
# generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 10.

# Create a 2 digit number in base 7, of which there are 49. Use only the first 40, where the units in base 10 have
# an equal probability of being each digit.
# Time - O(infinity), expected is sum of arithmeticoâ€“geometric sequence
# Space - O(1)
