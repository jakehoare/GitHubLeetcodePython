# https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/
# The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
# By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):
# "123", "132", "213", "231", "312", "321"
# Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

# Find each digit according to the ratio between k and the total number of possible permutations.
# Time - O(n**2) since each iteration adds one digit and O9n) for del from list
# Space - O(n) to store chars list
