# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-rounding-error-to-meet-target/
# Given an array of prices [p1,p2...,pn] and a target, round each price pi to Roundi(pi) so that the rounded array
# [Round1(p1),Round2(p2)...,Roundn(pn)] sums to the given target.
# Each operation Roundi(pi) could be either Floor(pi) or Ceil(pi).
# Return the string "-1" if the rounded array is impossible to sum to target.
# Otherwise, return the smallest rounding error, which is defined as Î£ |Roundi(pi) - (pi)| for i from 1 to n,
# as a string with three places after the decimal.

# For each price, add the floor to the base and record the remaining decimal digits.
# If the target is below the base or above the total ceiling, return "-1".
# Sort the remainders then iterate along, rounding up the largest remainders until the target is reached.
# Round down all reaminders not rounded up and add to result.
# Time - O(n log n)
# Space - O(n)
