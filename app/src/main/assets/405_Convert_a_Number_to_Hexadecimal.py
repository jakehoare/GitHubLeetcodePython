# https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-a-number-to-hexadecimal/
# Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method
# is used.
# All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
# The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero
# character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
# The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

# Repeatedly divide by 16, converting the remainder to a digit or letter (if > 9). Reverse the result so most
# significant bit is first.
# Time - O(log n)
# Space - O(log n)
