# https://leetcode.com/problems/count-numbers-with-unique-digits/
# Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 â‰¤ x < 10**n.

# For a single digit there are 10 choices.  For exactly 2 digits, all of the single digit results apart from 0 can have
# any of the 9 unused digit appended.  For exactly 3 digits we can append any of the 8 unused digits to each of the
# 2 digit solutions.  With more than 10 digits there are no more uniquie combinations.
# Time - O(1) since at most 10 digits
# Space - O(1)
