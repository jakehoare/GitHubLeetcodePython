# https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-blacklist/
# Given a blacklist B containing unique integers from [0, N), write a function to return a uniform random integer
# from [0, N) which is NOT in B.
# Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to systemâ€™s Math.random().

# Create a mapping so that all of the allowed numbers are together. Make the first part of the array the allowed
# whitelist. Find a list of all white numbers that are not in the first part of the array. For each black number that
# is in the first part of the array, map it to a white number that is not in the first part.
# Pick random indices from the length of the whitelist. If a number is mapped from black to white, return its mapping
# else the number is not blacklisted so return it.
# Time - O(n) for init, O(1) for pick.
# Space - O(n)
