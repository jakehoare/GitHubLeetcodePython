# https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/
# Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than âŒŠ n/3 âŒ‹ times.
# The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

# There can be at most 2 elements that make up more than 1/3 of the input.  Maintain 2 candidates, incrementing their
# counts as we find new instances.  If an element is neither candidate then decrement count of both candidates.
# If an element is more than 1/3 of an array then it will remain so when 3 different elements are removed.
# If a count reduces to zero then the next element is a new candidate.
# Finally check if candidates are actually > 1/3 of array.
# Time - O(n)
# Space - O(1)
