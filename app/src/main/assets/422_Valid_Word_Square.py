# https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-square/
# Given a sequence of words, check whether it forms a valid word square.
# A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string,
# where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

# Make a square of same length sides by padding words with spaces. If any word is longer than the first word then
# it is longer than the corresponding column so not a valid square. Check each row against each column.
# Time - O(n**2)
# Space - O(n**2)
