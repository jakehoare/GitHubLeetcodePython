# https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value-ii/
# Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
# You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
# You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

# Heap stores k closest values as tuples (- abs node diff from target, node value).  Top of heap is furthest from
# target.  If a node.val is closer than the furthest value in the heap then add it to the heap and check left and
# right subtrees.  If a node.val is further than the furthest value in the heap then the nodes of one subtree are all
# also further away.
# Alternatively, preorder traverse tree to create a sorted list.  Find the pair of values surrounding target and
# expand outwards always taking the closest to target. O(n + k) but always visits ever node.
# Time - O(n log k)
# Space - O(k)

# Definition for a binary tree node.
