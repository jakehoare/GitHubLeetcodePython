# https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/
# Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next
# Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its
# traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number.
# If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

# Stack holds indices of numbers without greater element, hence decreasing order. Pop of all numbers lower than
# current and set their next_greater to current. Repeat iteration over nums to account for circularity.
# Time - O(n)
# Space - O(n)
