# https://leetcode.com/problems/array-nesting/
# A zero-indexed array A of length N contains all integers from 0 to N-1. Find and return the longest length of set S,
# where S[i] = {A[i], A[A[i]], A[A[A[i]]], ... } subjected to the rule below.
# Suppose the first element in S starts with the selection of element A[i] of index = i, the next element in S should
# be A[A[i]], and then A[A[A[i]]]â€¦ By that analogy, we stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in S.

# Each set forms an independent cycle of nums. For each num, follow the cycle until a num repeats. Update the longest
# and add all nus in the cycle to the seen set. Iterate over nums finding the cycle for each num, ignoring any num
# already known to be part of a cycle.
# Time - O(n)
# Space - O(n)
