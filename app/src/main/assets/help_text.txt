If you are online, the app contains all the problems that I have solved.
This is all of the algorithm problems on Leetcode (perhaps apart from the newest few).
The list of problems on Leetcode is continually increasing and I aim to keep the app updated.

If you are offline, the list of problems is updated when a new version of this app is released. Updates occur about every few months.

Solutions include:
    - problem description from Leetcode
    - explanation of the solution
    - time and space complexity
    - commented Python code

I aim to have the fastest solutions in terms of big-O time complexity.
However, it is important that the code can easily be understood. For that reason, solutions are usually not the most concise code possible.

**** MENU ITEMS ****

*** SEARCH ***
Click on "Enter a query, then click Search" to enter a search term.
A search term can be part of a problem name (e.g. "array") or a problem number.
Difficulty levels of "easy", "medium" or "hard" can also be used as search terms.
Searches are case-insensitive.
To revert to the full list, delete the term and click the search button.

*** RANDOM ***
Displays a random problem from those currently shown on the home screen.
If there is a search term, this is a random problem from amongst the search results.

*** HIDE/REVEAL ***
Toggles hiding the solution, so only the question is displayed.

*** FEEDBACK ***
This opens your email application and allows you to give me feedback.
You can give feedback on an individual problem, such as a correction or clarification.
I am also happy to receive feedback on the overall application.

*** FORWARD ***
This opens your email application and allows you to forward the problem solution to an email address.
