Solutions include:
    - problem description from Leetcode
    - explanation of the solution
    - time and space complexity
    - commented Python code

I aim to have the fastest solutions in terms of big-O time complexity.
However, it is important that the code can easily be understood. For that reason, solutions are usually not the most concise code possible.
